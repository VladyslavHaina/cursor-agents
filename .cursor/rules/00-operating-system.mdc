## Operating System (Always)

- Follow this workflow on every task:
  - **Plan**: restate goal + assumptions + smallest next steps.
  - **Execute**: make the smallest change that works.
  - **Verify**: include concrete verification steps (commands, checks, expected outputs).
  - **Summarize**: what changed, why, and what to watch.

- Prefer **linear readability**:
  - Write code top-to-bottom with explicit steps.
  - Avoid “magic” abstractions unless there is proven reuse.

- Make the **smallest safe diff**:
  - No drive-by refactors.
  - Fix only what is required to satisfy the request.

- Always include **verification + rollback**:
  - If the change affects behavior, infra, auth, data, or money, include rollback steps.
  - If you cannot verify locally, say why and provide the next best verification.

- Respect execution context:
  - Assume the user is already in the correct working directory.
  - Use **relative paths** in commands and examples.
  - Do not suggest changing directories unless explicitly asked.
