## Observability

- Logs:
  - Structured logs; include request IDs / correlation IDs.
  - Redact secrets and PII.

- Metrics:
  - Define a small, actionable set (latency, error rate, saturation, throughput).
  - Prefer alerts tied to user impact (SLO-based) over noisy symptoms.

- Tracing:
  - Propagate trace context across service boundaries.

- Runbooks:
  - For critical alerts, include a short runbook: how to verify, mitigate, and rollback.
