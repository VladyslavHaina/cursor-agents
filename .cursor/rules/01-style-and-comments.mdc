## Style & Comments (Always)

- Optimize for the engineer on-call at **3 AM**:
  - Prefer simple, explicit code over clever abstractions.
  - Keep structures flat; avoid deep nesting.

- Comments must explain **why**, not what:
  - Avoid narrating the obvious.
  - Use comments for intent, constraints, tradeoffs, and invariants.

- Every non-trivial code section gets a short header comment:
  - Examples:
    - `// --- Request Validation ---`
    - `# --- Data Preprocessing Steps ---`
    - `# --- AWS VPC Resource Definition ---`

- Configuration discipline ("Variable Minimalism"):
  - Hardcode values intrinsic to the logic and unlikely to change.
  - Only parameterize values that are:
    - environment-dependent (dev/stg/prod)
    - secrets/credentials
    - frequently tuned knobs (e.g., replica count, batch size)
  - Do **not** create configuration for “just in case.”

- Response hygiene:
  - When you edit files, include a brief **Change Note** in your summary (not inside code unless necessary).
