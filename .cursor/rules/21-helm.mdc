## Helm

- Values minimalism:
  - Expose only high-level knobs (replicas, image tag, resources, env overrides).
  - Do not template internal ConfigMaps unless required for environment injection.

- Template hygiene:
  - Keep templates readable; avoid excessive helper indirection.
  - Use standard labels and selectors.
  - Avoid surprising defaults; document non-obvious behaviors.

- Upgrade safety:
  - Make changes compatible with `helm upgrade` (immutable fields awareness).
  - If schema changes are needed, call out migration/rollback steps.

- Verification:
  - Provide `helm template` / `helm lint` (when available) and a basic render check.
  - When possible, include a diff (`helm diff upgrade`, if available) or an upgrade dry-run (`helm upgrade --dry-run --debug`) before applying.
