## Terraform

- Prefer the **smallest change that works**; no unrelated refactors.

- Versioning and reproducibility:
  - Pin `terraform.required_version` and `required_providers`.
  - Prefer explicit provider configuration (regions/aliases) over implicit defaults.

- State and safety:
  - Use remote state + locking for shared environments.
  - Prefer **plan-first** workflows (`plan` → review → `apply`).
  - Avoid `apply` changes you cannot explain line-by-line.

- Modules (only when it helps):
  - Use modules for **distinct logical resources** (e.g., Networking, EKS Cluster).
  - Do not wrap single resources in a “module” unless reused.
  - Keep the module interface small (don’t parameterize everything).

- IAM and security:
  - Enforce least privilege; document *why* permissions are needed.
  - Avoid wildcards unless constrained by conditions and justified.

- Naming and tags:
  - Use `locals` for naming conventions.
  - Standardize tags/labels where supported.

- Outputs and docs:
  - Add outputs intentionally (consumer-focused; don’t expose everything).
  - For non-trivial modules, include a short README: inputs/outputs/example/verify/rollback.

- Verification:
  - Run formatting and validation (`terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`).
  - If appropriate, include a `terraform plan` step and review notes.
