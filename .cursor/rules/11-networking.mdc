## Networking

- Default to **private** networking:
  - Private subnets for workloads; public subnets only for edge components.
  - Minimize inbound exposure; prefer ALB/NLB + WAF where appropriate.

- Segmentation:
  - Separate tiers (edge/app/data) using subnets + security groups.
  - Separate environments (dev/stg/prod) with clear boundaries.

- Security groups / firewall rules:
  - Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` inbound unless explicitly required and justified.
  - Constrain egress where practical (destinations/ports).
  - Prefer referencing security groups / prefix lists over broad CIDRs.

- Routing:
  - Keep route tables explicit and readable.
  - Document non-obvious routes (peering/TGW/VPN/egress-only paths).

- Observability and auditability:
  - Enable flow logs where needed; ensure log retention meets requirements.
  - Make it easy to answer: “what can talk to what, and why?”
