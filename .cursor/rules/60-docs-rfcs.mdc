## Docs / RFCs / ADRs

- Prefer short, decision-focused writing:
  - Write **why**, not a full tutorial.
  - Include alternatives considered and tradeoffs.

- ADR minimum template:
  - Context
  - Decision
  - Alternatives
  - Consequences

- Runbooks:
  - Include: symptoms, how to verify, mitigation steps, rollback steps.
  - Prefer copy/pasteable commands.
