## Frontend

- Accessibility is not optional:
  - Use semantic HTML, labels, keyboard navigation, and sensible focus management.

- Correctness and resilience:
  - Handle loading/error/empty states explicitly.
  - Avoid state leaks and stale async updates.

- Performance:
  - Avoid unnecessary rerenders; prefer memoization only when measured.
  - Keep bundles lean; avoid dependencies for minor utilities.

- Testing:
  - Add/adjust tests for behavior changes.
  - Prefer component/unit tests for logic; reserve e2e for critical paths.
