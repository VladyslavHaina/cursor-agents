## Data

- Reproducibility:
  - Pipelines should be idempotent and re-runnable.
  - Pin dependencies and document dataset versions.

- Schemas and migrations:
  - Treat schemas as contracts; make changes intentionally.
  - Prefer backward-compatible changes when possible.

- Privacy and security:
  - Minimize PII exposure; redact logs and samples.
  - Enforce least privilege access to data stores.

- Validation:
  - Validate inputs/outputs (schemas, row counts, distribution checks) where practical.
